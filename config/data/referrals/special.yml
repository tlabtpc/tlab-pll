    title: Aids Legal Referral Panel (ALRP)
    description: The ALRP works with clients who have HIV/AIDS. ALRP is able to serve some clients with its own in-house lawyers, and for issues it cannot help with, it will help clients find a private attorney from its panels of attorneys. If your client is eligible for their services, it is a good place to try. If your client tries here and is unable to find help that she can afford, submit an inquiry to Project Legal Link as there may be another referral available.
